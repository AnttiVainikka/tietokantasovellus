# Review Site

## About
A website where users can post and read reviews of movies, tv-shows, books, comics and such.

## Functionality
A user can write a review of anything they want and read the reviews other users have already written and comment on them. Comments can also be replied to. Users can additionally report works, reviews, comments and replies they deem inappropriate provided they are not the author in which case they can edit/delete them. A visitor can't post reviews, comments and replies but they can read and report them. Moderators can go through reports and take appropriate action. Moderators themselves cannot report anything as they have no need to.

## User roles

In order to test being a moderator, you can use the account "Modi" (password: "moderaattori"). If you do, I ask you to not delete anything you didn't create.
