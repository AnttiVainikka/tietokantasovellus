# Review Site

## About
A website where users can post and read reviews of movies, tv-shows, books, comics and such.

## Functionality
A visitor can search works, create an account, log in and read reviews, comments and replies. A user can search works, log out and write, read and edit/delete their own reviews, comments and replies. Additionally everyone can report works, reviews, comments and replies. A moderator can delete any account, work, review, comment or reply and also go through reports and take appropriate action. Currently moderators cannot delete reports but deleting something that has been reported will delete all reports conserning it. Also users cannot be reported yet.

In order to test being a moderator you can use the account "Modi" (password: "moderaattori"). If you do, I ask you to not delete anything you didn't create.
